Artemis Financial wants to have secure practices to store and move data for its customers.

Utilizing tools that I practices using in the course. Suppressing false positives was a strength of mine. Secure coding makes sure the integrity of the information the company is protecting is preserved. A company can maximize business output if its coding properly.

The hardest part of the process was fighting all of the incompatibilites because I wanted to use Eclipse on my machine. But I do highly recommend doing it all outside of the VM environment.

Having things like the certificate that you use on your machine, along with tools that AES provides.

Double and triple checking the reports after the last step of the assignment was how I personally made sure it was secure.

The resources I used were all the free tools that Maven offers, as well as using all the links eclipse provides when it runs into an error.

I could honestly show them the second project, as it shows all the skills we learned throughout the whole course, its just all neatly packed into that assignment.
